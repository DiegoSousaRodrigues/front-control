## About The Project

**Front Control** is a front-end application designed to offer a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing and interacting with your data. Built with a modern technology stack, it emphasizes code quality, scalability, and performance.

This project is likely a dashboard, admin panel, or a settings interface for a larger system.

## Key Features

- **Modern JavaScript:** Utilizes the latest ECMAScript features for clean and efficient code.
- **Advanced CSS Processing:** Leverages **PostCSS** to enable next-generation CSS features, optimizations, and plugins.
- **Robust Code Quality:** Enforced with **ESLint**, including rules to prevent dependency cycles (`import/no-cycle`), ensuring a maintainable and stable codebase.
- **Flexible Build Process:** The project's dependencies like `micromatch` and `braces` suggest a powerful and configurable build system (e.g., Webpack, Vite, or Rollup) for handling assets and modules.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** (Recommended) Structure your application into reusable and isolated components for better organization and scalability.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm**
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/front-control.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh

    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`
  Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

- `npm test`
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build`
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- `npm run lint`
  Lints the code to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using a variety of powerful open-source libraries. Here are some of the key ones identified:

- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
  - **eslint-plugin-import**: ESLint plugin with rules that help validate proper imports.
- **micromatch**: A highly-optimized glob matching library used for file matching in build tools.
- **braces**: A fast and accurate brace expansion library, for creating regex-like patterns.

_(You can add your main framework like React, Vue, or Angular here!)_
